# simple-mbc3O-test
A simple MBC3 test ROM that prints results to the serial output.
It is meant as a starting point for future MBC3O (formerly known as
MBC30) testing.

## Building

Run `make` to assemble and link `main.gb` using RGBDS. The resulting
ROM is titled `MBC3OTEST` and built for an MBC3 cartridge with RAM.
